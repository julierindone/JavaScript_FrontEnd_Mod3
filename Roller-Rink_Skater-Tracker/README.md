The Roller-Rink Skater-Tracker started out as the passenger counter app that's the first project in Module 3 (Javascript) of the Scrimba FrontEnd Career Path.

Open Skate starts at 6pm and continues into the early morning. Hit the *ADD* button for each guest admitted, and at the end of each hour, hit *SAVE* to submit the hour's admissions and start back at zero.

The app looks best on a phone or iPad, but if you're counting skaters at the (fictional) Xanadu Roller Rink, you probably don't need anything bigger than that, anyway.
